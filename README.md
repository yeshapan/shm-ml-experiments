## **Machine Learning Experiments in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)**

This repository contains my notebooks, experiments, and datasets related to applying Machine Learning (and later on Deep Learning) techniques in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).

The work here is mostly exploratory - a space for testing ideas, building small prototypes, and documenting learning progress in the field.
